# Sorters 2024
A collection of common sorting algorithms implemented in Java for integers. There is a runner that demonstrates them, comparing their time and moves to sort the same sequence of integers. Written in 2024 for my Algorithms and Data Structures college course.
## Running the code
1. Download the .java files into a single folder.
2. Open the folder in an IDE and run "SortRunner.java"
*Alternatively...*
1. Download the .java files into a single folder.
